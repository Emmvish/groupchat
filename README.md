It's an online chat application whose front-end has been developed using HTML/CSS and back-end has been developed using Node.js (Express and Socket.io npm packages) and client-side Javascript. You enter your username and the name of the room you'd like to go and have a chat at, and then you shall be able to send text messages as well as your current location to members of only that group. Note that, the chat messages are censored and any bad words are automatically detected. Also, the user-name should be unique with respect to the room with which the person wishes to connect.
